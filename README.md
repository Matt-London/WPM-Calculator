# WPM-Calculator

This program looks to calculate a user's typing speed in words per minute by serving random quotes from an API and asking the user to type as fast as possible.


## How To Launch The Program

This was built using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. You may launch it using your favorite method, but personally I use the Live Server plugin for VS Code.

## How To Use The Program

After launching the program, assuming you have an internet connection, it will automatically start serving quotes. You can start typing whenever you would like and it will begin to calculate your typing speed. After fully completing a quote (with no errors), it will refresh and serve the next quote. In order to get an accurate measure of your typing speed, you should look to type for at least one minute.
